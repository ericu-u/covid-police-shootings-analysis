    "We are interested in studying gun shooting events in America because we want to know how serious is this affecting many Americans. We want to know why American people keep dying under mass shootings. Specifically, we want to know how a gun shooting happens, why a gun shooting happens, and who a gun shooting targets. Our first hypothesis is that gun shooting events should decrease after the outbreak of COVID-19 because of the stay home orders that prevent people shooting others. The article from Bloogberg confirms our prediction, since \"the number of mass shooting incidents, killings and firearm injuries all dropped as states and cities took aggressive measures to contain the virus\" (2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides looking for the gun shooting rate between pre-COVID and post-COVID, we also want to know about the correlation between gun violence and race because we want to know whether a certain race is being discriminated by the police force. CNN has done a research on the similar topic, showing a chart of how black Americans has more firarm homicide death rate than white Americans (1). We want to know whether there is a similar trend between the race and the police when it comes to police shooting.\n",

    "The datasets we are trying to obtain are from Kaggle, which is a platform with thousands of open datasets. Since they are posted publicly on Kaggle, we could safely assume that the publishers are aware of others' usage. However, it is extremely hard to get informed consent from each subject, especially for shooting cases or Covid-19 cases in the data collection process. We hope both of the datasets come from national or government institutions and track accidents that occurred in real life; thus they do not discriminate against any groups unintentionally. Also, we should make sure that the size of the datasets is large enough for us to make a scientific and reliable conclusion, which will be replicable in the future.\n",

We need to reach out to the dataset publisher to 1) obtain his/her permission to use the dataset, 2) the subjects are aware of study, and 3) ensure that the dataset’s reliability and the data. Also, during the project, each of us should remind ourselves that each observation represents a single human being, and we have to conduct our project in an ethical and equitable manner to further limit the potential bias. By following those above, we could confirm that our project is conducted within ethical guidelines.\n"
