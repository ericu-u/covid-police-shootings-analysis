    "We are interested in studying gun shooting events in America because we want to know how serious is this affecting many Americans. We want to know why American people keep dying under mass shootings. Specifically, we want to know where a gun shooting happens, what kind of weapons do shooters carry, and the characteristics of the shooters. It is important to know about these attributes because reports show that active shooters often share characteristics and exhibit similar behavior in the weeks and months before an attack (1). Our hypothesis is that gun shooting events should decrease after the outbreak of COVID-19 because of the stay home orders that prevent people shooting others. The article from Bloomberg confirms our prediction, since \"the number of mass shooting incidents, killings and firearm injuries all dropped as states and cities took aggressive measures to contain the virus\" (2).\n",

Overall, our result shows that there is correlation between gun shooting event frequency and COVID-19 pandemic."

The dataset comes from The Washington Post, which is one of the largest newspaper publisher; thus we trust that dataset would carefully reflect and record each fetal case.

We had large number of data before COVID-19, but we lacked the data after COVID-19 since it only occurred for almost a year in the U.S.. Another limitation that we had was finding the causality between COVID-19 and the number of police shooting cases. Altough we had proven that the cases did decrease after COVID-19, we were still unsure of whether COVID-19 was the (only) factor that was behind this drop.\n",
